wordpress plugin - multi-site history log

This is a highly modified version of the history plugin.
It has been extended for the Orhtopedic Surgery department at UCSF in the following ways:
 - view all sub (multi-site/multi-post) logs in one place.  Each multi-site will show the same history.
 - support special page types (defined with Magic Fields module) such as Biography, News, etc.
 - aggregate multi post entries into a single line entry. 
 - multi post entries are tagged as "multipost";
 - clicking on a multi-post item expands the items to show links to each site post edit page.
 - extended occasions to support multi-post entries
 - right-side tags indicate the site or multi-sites of an entry, in color columns.
